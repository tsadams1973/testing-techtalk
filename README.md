# testing-techtalk

This is effectively an out-of-the box dotnet core web app and web api that I used for a tech talk on automated testing that covered API testing with Postman and UI testing with Selenium.

## Postman
We used Postman to test the simple API in the solution. The Postman folder includes the Postman collection and environment files.

With these trivial examples we demonstrated:
- How to set up a postman collection.
- How to set up a postman environment.
- How to write simple tests in postman.
- How to run the collection in postman.
- How to run the collection from the command line with newman.
- How to incoroporate postman collections in an azure devops pipeline.
- How to transform the environment files in the pipeline.
- How to run the tests with newman as part of the pipeline.
